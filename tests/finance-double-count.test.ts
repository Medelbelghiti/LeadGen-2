/**
 * Regression tests for the FINANCIAL DOUBLE-COUNTING bug.
 *
 * The old `trueOwnershipCost` accepted a `monthlyFixedCents` that was
 * ADDED on top of `monthlyAverage`, which already included insurance/tax.
 * This silently double-counted insurance/tax.
 *
 * The fix renames it to `forwardLookingFixedCents` and adds explicit
 * ASSUMPTIONS so callers understand the overlap risk.
 *
 * These tests prove the math:
 *   monthlyAverage (in cents) — covers ACTUAL recorded categories
 *   forwardLookingFixedCents (in cents/month) — ONLY added when caller
 *     knows it's a forward-looking cost NOT already in monthlyAverage
